A common way to summarize data is by computing aggregations such as mean, median, maximum and minimum. These aggregations or statistical measures (as they are commonly referred to) describe the general and specific characteristics of our data. This is why these types of aggregations are sometimes referred to as descriptive statistics or summary statistics. The pandas DataFrame provides several methods for computing descriptive statistics. By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned:

* how to describe a DataFrame
* how to get simple aggregations
* how to get group-level aggregations
