# Preparing Data for Machine Learning

## 04_02b file
Missing data could arise as a result of changes in data collection methods, human error, bias, or simply the lack of reliable input. There are several ways to deal with missing data. By the end of the tutorial, you will have learned:

* how to detect missing data
* how to remove missing data
* how to resolve missing data

During this step, we often have to restructure some of our data so that it conforms to a particular characteristic. This is known as normalization or standardization. There are several ways to normalize data in Python. By the end of the tutorial, you will have learned:

* how to perform min-max normalization
* how to perform z-score normalization

In order to get an unbiased assessment of the performance of a supervised machine learning model, we need to evaluate it based on data that it did not previously encounter during the training process. To accomplish this, we must first split our data into a training subset and a test subset prior to the model build stage. One common way to split data in this fashion is by creating non-overlapping subsets of the original data using one of several sampling approaches. By the end of the tutorial, you will have learned:

* how to split data using simple random sampling
* how to split data using stratified random sampling
